					<p>Hi! I'm Gabe.</p>
					<p>
						I'm a DevOps Engineer and Software Developer based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA. I'm
						passionate about automating processes, crafting innovative solutions, and staying up-to-date
						with the latest technologies. I specialize in building robust systems using Golang and Vue.js,
						and I enjoy exploring new ideas and tinkering with self-hosted home infrastructure. My
						<router-link to="/projects">project</router-link> page showcases some of my most notable works.
					</p>
					<p>
						To ensure efficient development and deployment, I utilize containers, GitHub Actions,
						Kubernetes, and GitOps. These tools allow me to streamline the development lifecycle and ensure
						that my projects run seamlessly. If you're looking for a reliable, results-driven DevOps
						Engineer and Software Developer, look no further! I'm always excited to collaborate on new
						projects and leverage my skills to help organizations achieve their goals.
